I am currently an undergraduate student at Arizona State University majoring in Human Systems Engineering, with a dedicated focus on Human-Computer Interaction and User Experience. My academic and professional journey is driven by a deep commitment to advancing the ways in which people engage with technology. Through rigorous research, design, and evaluation, I aim to improve the usability, accessibility, and overall effectiveness of technological systems to foster more intuitive and meaningful user experiences.

My research interests lie at the intersection of human factors, user experience, psychology, computer science, and design, reflecting a multidisciplinary approach essential to addressing complex challenges in HCI. Over the past year, I have gained substantial professional research experience across multiple companies and academic settings, where I have led and contributed to empirical studies in both industry and research laboratories. Most recently, I served as a research assistant in ASUâ€™s Evolution, Ecology, and Social Behavior Lab, and I am excited to continue my research as a research assistant in the Science of Learning and Technology/Learning Educational Institute for the upcoming Fall 2025 semester.

In recognition of my academic and research excellence, I have been honored as an All-Arizona Academic Team awardee. I am also an active student affiliate of both the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society and the ACM Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction, which have further enriched my perspective on the evolving landscape of HCI research.

I am eager to pursue doctoral studies to deepen my expertise and contribute novel insights to the field of human-computer interaction, ultimately advancing the design of technology that meaningfully improves human experiences.
