I am an undergraduate Human Systems Engineering student at Arizona State University, with a dedicated focus on human-computer interaction and user experience. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of human factors, computer science, and design. Through my work, I aim to improve the usability, accessibility, and overall effectiveness of technological systems, as well as understand the reasons behind how and why people interact with technology the way they do.

A complete CV is available here.
